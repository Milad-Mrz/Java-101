# Java-101
Series of Java Tutorials for beginners


Learning Java in one day is not realistic. Java is a complex programming language with a large number of features and concepts that can take months or even years to fully understand and master. However, if you have some programming experience and just want to get a basic understanding of Java syntax and concepts, it is possible to get a rough idea of the language in a short period of time.

Here are first steps to start with basics of Java:
- Install a Java development environment: You will need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) and a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Java code. Some popular IDEs for Java include Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans.

- Learn the **basic syntax**: Java is a C-style language, which means that it has a similar syntax to other languages like C, C++, and C#. Start by learning the basic syntax of Java, including the structure of a Java program, variables, data types, operators, and control structures like loops and conditionals.

- Understand **object-oriented programming**: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects and classes. Familiarize yourself with the key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

- Practice writing code: The best way to learn any programming language is by writing code. Try working through some basic Java exercises or challenges to get a feel for the language and how to use it to solve problems.

Remember that learning any programming language requires a lot of practice and dedication. While it is possible to get a basic understanding of Java in one day, becoming proficient in the language will take significantly longer.


**1- Java basic syntax**

Every Java file ends in *.java, and it should contain a class inside with the **same name** which starting with capital letter, and then you should place a main method/function or void inside that class. name of the void must be in small letters.
The braces { } indicate the scope of the structure involved, like a class or the main method. A method is a function belong a class


```
public Class Main{
    public void main(){
        ...
    }
}
```

**public:** is access modifier.  <br />
**Class:** is group of functions.  <br />
**void:** is the phrase used for writing functions.  <br />

**Data types**

    int hoursInADay = 24;
- **int** to store integers, that is, numbers without decimal digits.
- **double** to store numbers with decimal digits.
- **boolean** to store true/false values.
- **String** to save literal messages.

**Print:**
- System.out.print()	Prints a message in the console.
- System.out.println()	Prints a message in the console, then ends the line. <br />

**! Remember:** After every command, like those, you must place a **semicolon ;** at the end of the line.
