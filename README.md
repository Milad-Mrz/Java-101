# Java-101
Series of Java Tutorials for beginners


Learning Java in one day is not realistic. Java is a complex programming language with a large number of features and concepts that can take months or even years to fully understand and master. However, if you have some programming experience and just want to get a basic understanding of Java syntax and concepts, it is possible to get a rough idea of the language in a short period of time.

Here are first steps to start with basics of Java:
- Install a Java development environment: You will need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) and a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Java code. Some popular IDEs for Java include Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans.

- Learn the **basic syntax**: Java is a C-style language, which means that it has a similar syntax to other languages like C, C++, and C#. Start by learning the basic syntax of Java, including the structure of a Java program, variables, data types, operators, and control structures like loops and conditionals.

- Understand **object-oriented programming**: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects and classes. Familiarize yourself with the key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

- Practice writing code: The best way to learn any programming language is by writing code. Try working through some basic Java exercises or challenges to get a feel for the language and how to use it to solve problems.

Remember that learning any programming language requires a lot of practice and dedication. While it is possible to get a basic understanding of Java in one day, becoming proficient in the language will take significantly longer.
